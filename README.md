**Categories:** Initially, you won't have any categories, so if you're planning to maintain a substantial number of templates, it's advisable to create categories for better organization. You can create as many categories as needed; there are no limitations.

**Attributes:** In addition to categories, you have the option to organize your templates based on attributes. Attributes are small pieces of data that describe your template. For instance, if you want to sort your template by language or gender, you can create an attribute called "Language" and provide attribute values such as "EN," "PL," "DE," etc. Once attributes are set up, you can easily sort your templates based on these predefined attributes.
